my answers are stored in this repository

PreConditions:
Assuming environment were already set up and all were in a latest version
node.js
NPM
cypress
testRunner
chrome
vs code

github repository
git clone https://github.com/maleozaf/goreact.git

notes:
1. please use the main branch when executing the test
2. this is my first time using cypress so i didnt use page object model or any framework that will help to organize the test scripts. But when I have enough time, I will slowly proceed with POM
3. i have created the test files and this is the sequence:
intructor_signup.js
instructor_login.js
createCourse.js
student_signup.js
student_login.js
4. please manually copy the link provided after courseCreation.js and paste it in student_signup.js for the invitation, I am sorry if I havent seen any work around for pasting the clipboard so that it will dynamically invite students.
